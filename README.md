# Disney Friend Finder

This was the homework for week 13 of my coding boot camp. This week's challenge was to create a "friend finder" app that provides users with a survey, and compares their answers to other people to find the best match. When the match is determined, the user gets a modal that displays their match's name and a photo.

I added a twist and added some disney characters to the mix.

After answering the questions, you get a match to a disney character.

# The set up:

The home page explains what the site does and provides a link to the survey.
 
There is a text entry for name and a photo (URL).
There are ten questions with dropdowns to choose from 1 - 5.

When the form is submitted, the app calculates the total score of the current user, and compares it to the other disney characters in the array.

The best match is determined and displayed with the name and image inside a bootstrap modal popup.
